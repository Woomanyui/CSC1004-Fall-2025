# CSC1004-Fall-2025

Welcome to my CSC1004 course repository! This repo contains three key projects that I developed during my freshman year at CUHK(SZ), showcasing my programming skills and understanding of core computer science concepts.

# ðŸ“‚ Repository Overview
This repository includes the following projects:

Project Name	Description	Language
JavaChatRoom	A basic chatroom application implemented in Java supporting multiple clients and message broadcasting.	Java
GomokuGame	A console-based Gomoku (Five-in-a-Row) game featuring game logic and user interaction.	Java
SnakeGame	A classic Snake game developed in Python with simple graphics and keyboard controls.	Python

# ðŸš€ Project Highlights
## 1. JavaChatRoom
Implemented a client-server architecture using Java sockets.
Supports multiple users chatting in real-time.
Demonstrates understanding of network programming and multithreading.

## 2. GomokuGame
Developed the game logic for Gomoku including win condition checks.
Console-based interface allowing two players to compete.
Practiced OOP concepts in Java.

## 3. SnakeGame
Created with Python and Pygame library.
Classic Snake gameplay with user controls and score tracking.
Improved skills in event-driven programming and graphics.

# ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools
Languages: Java, Python
Libraries: Java Standard Library (java.net, java.util), Pygame (for SnakeGame)
Development Tools: IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code


# ðŸ“š What I Learned
Network communication and socket programming in Java.
Object-oriented design and game logic implementation.
Event-driven programming and simple game development with Python.
Practical experience working on projects from design to deployment.

Just a friendly reminder: these projects are my own original work for CSC1004. Please donâ€™t copy the code here directly for your assignments. Feel free to use it as a reference or inspiration, but always write your own code and remember to cite any sources you use. Letâ€™s keep it honest and fair for everyone!
